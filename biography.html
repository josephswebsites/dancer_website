					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Joseph Alexander Grossberg</strong> was born in Auburn Hills and raised in a small township called White Lake, on the East side of Michigan.&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the years, Joseph has explored many genres including ballet, jazz, hip hop, modern, tap, Afro-Caribbean, Yoga, and contact improvisation.
					</p>
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before coming to Western Michigan University (WMU) Joseph’s training took place at Karen’s School of Dance, Dance Dynamics Performing Arts Center, and Eisenhower Dance Center.&nbsp;&nbsp;At the age of 13, he was fortunate enough to dance professionally in <i>Dino’s Christmas Extravaganza</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, Joseph danced at conventions and summer intensives which prompted him to pursue dance in college;&nbsp;&nbsp;the most encouraging consist of the White Mountain Summer Dance Festival and the Michigan Youth Arts Festival.
					</p>
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now since coming to Western, Joseph has improved his technical abilities, performed in the Winter Gala Dance Concert, and choreographed informal pieces for Noon Dance Showings on campus.
					</p>
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joseph has progressed from Modern Technique I to Modern Technique III and has taken master classes from guest artists; a few of them being Willy Shives, a former principal dancer with Joffrey Ballet, Brett Perry from Aszure Barton & Artists, and Jake Deibert from the Taylor 2 Dance Company.&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, Joseph was a member of Hip Hop ConnXion for the 2017 season;&nbsp;&nbsp;this company, founded in 1999 by Suavé, is a student run organization that follows the mission “Our future is here today, the survival of dance rests on the shoulders of our youth.&nbsp;&nbsp;Teach them well and our future will be strong.&nbsp;&nbsp;You can choose to start educating tomorrow, or you can choose to start educating now.&nbsp;&nbsp;We choose to start now!”
					</p>
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only has Joseph improved, but he has performed in Great Works that were restaged at WMU! In the Winter Gala Dance Concert of 2016 Joseph performed as the ‘Student’ in Lew Christensen’s <i>Con Amore</i>, and in the concert of 2018, he was an understudy for Paul Taylor’s <i>Esplanade</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the rehearsals, Joseph worked with Leslie Young, the representative and répétiteur for the works of Lew Christensen, Ruth Andrien, the Artistic Director of the Taylor 2 Dance Company, and the company dancers - Rei Akazawa, Amanda Stevenson, Johnny Vorsteg, Jake Deibert, Irving Amigon, and Sloan Pearson.
					</p>
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joseph has also choreographed and performed works of his own; he has presented solos at informal Noon Dance Showings at WMU - the videos of these performances can be found in the Videos tab!
					</p>
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of which, Joseph is a dual major!
